# Adventures of Poggo
**Introduction**

This is a 3D third-person point & click RPG. The main goal when working on this project was for me to gain knowledge on the topic of making a light point & click RPG and various systems that go into making a game of that genre, such as the inventory, equipment and quest systems.

The game is fully playable and contains most of the elements that you would expect from a regular video game. Since the main emphasis was put on gameplay, other parts may not be as intricate. Keep in mind that this is more of a gameplay and mechanics show off, rather than a fully developed product, and as such it features only a few quests.

## Specifics
**Systems**

The game features an inventory system, that allows the player to collect and store any items that he finds along on his journey. Thanks to the equipment mechanic the player is able to equip and unequip the items he collects, improving his attack and/or health stats. The game also features a quest system that grants the player the ability to take and turn in quests, tracking and displaying his progress the whole time.

The player is able to freely and automatically move on the map, interact with items and NPCs, and fight with enemies. The HUD displays the players health and current objective, as well as the health and level of any enemy in his vicinity.
